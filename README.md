# Project-Classicraft
I am proud to announce a project that while small in size, has not been attempted in this form since the very dawn of Minecraft mods. I am here before you here to attempt to turn back the hands of time, and present a what if. What if Minecraft never left it's roots. What if the feeling of Minecraft Beta could truly be preserved in time, while still maintaining the modern luxuries we enjoy from the game today. What if the game we see today was still following the vision we all saw so many years ago, in the game's youth. Today I attempt to answer these questions. Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you Classicraft.
